58737 (of 58737) markers to be included from [ qcd.map ]
89 individuals read from [ qcd.ped ] 
89 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
44 cases, 45 controls and 0 missing
89 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading 3 covariates from [ pcs.txt ] with nonmissing values for 89 individuals
Selected subset of 1 from 3 covariates
For these, nonmissing covariate values for 89 individuals
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 58737 SNPs
89 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.995313
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 58737 SNPs
After filtering, 44 cases, 45 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 89 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Writing logistic model association results to [ pc1.assoc.logistic ] 
Computing corrected significance values (FDR, Sidak, etc)
Genomic inflation factor (based on median chi-squared) is 1.02424
Mean chi-squared statistic is 0.961775
Correcting for 58737 tests
